In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "Intuitively, for a learned classifier to be able to generalize well to unseen data it should meet the following three conditions: (1) it should have been trained on 'enough' examples, (2) it should fit the training data (3) it should be 'simple'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has about 139 unique values. I was recently at a conference about AI and Ralf, the director of machine learning at Amazon, said that they usually try to have at least one example for each unique value. We have 300 samples in our training set so we are in good shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the following algorithms for my project:\n",
    "\n",
    "** Naive Bayes: **\n",
    "Naive Bayes only needs a small sample size compared to more sophisticated models to learn the necessary parameters. Although this algorithm oversimplifies, according to the sklearn documentation this algorithm performs really well in many real-world applications. I also chose this model, because Naive Bayes is extremly fast compared to more sophisticated models and may result in cost savings.\n",
    "Naive Bayes is used for classification and different models based on different distributions are available. I chose the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm, even though our data, after processing the feature columns, is Bernoulli Distributed (GaussianNB performed better in a test)\n",
    "\n",
    "** SVM: **\n",
    "Support Vector MAchines work for can handle classification and regression tasks. When looking at the graduation rate it becomes clear that the two categories are unequally distributes. Support Vector Machines can handle these types of problems well. Furthermore, the attribute space is highly dimensional and with the flexibility of kernel functions we can try multiple kernels with grid search. This is why I think they are a great fit for this type of problem.\n",
    "One disadvantage of SVM's can be that they tend to perform poorly, if the number of features is greater than the number of samples, which is not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Boosting: **\n",
    "Boosting, specifically the AdaBoost algorithm trains multiple weak classifiers on training data and then combines these simple models into a single boosted classifier. The combination of these classifiers is done through a weighted sum of the weak classifiers, with the weight being determined by the weak classifiers accuracy.\n",
    "Boosting was originally developed for classification problems. Since then it has been generalized to support regression as well.\n",
    "The student data is highly dimensional. Even though each weak learner is essentially a linear classifier when the individual classifieres are combined the final model can be highly dimensional, thus it will fit the training data well. Problematic is that one has to find the optimal learning rate, depth and number of estimators to avoid bias/high variance."

    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."

    "In my opinion not only the peformance and training/prediction time matters, but also which types of mistakes are made. For some students it may be catastrophic, when they are predicted to graduate, but are actually at risk - this would be a false positive.\n",
    "To evaluate the models based on this metric I implemented a confusion matrix - the false positives are in the top right corner. The model, that performs best, while also minimizing the number of false positives is the model based on the AdaBoostClassifier. Furthermore, this model also performs the best on the majority of students (i.e. 300 samples).\n",

    "In the beginning the model tries to find a line through the datapoints to divide the students who graduated and the ones who didn't. The model then prioritizes the students that it didn't get right the first time (i.e. gives them more weight) and then based on the newly weighted dataset it tries again to find a line through the dataset to divide the students. This is repeated a lot of times. The model remebers each line it drew during each iteration. After a certain number of iterations the model combines the lines from each iteration to build the complex model, that can classify most students."
