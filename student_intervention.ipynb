In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "Intuitively, for a learned classifier to be able to generalize well to unseen data it should meet the following three conditions: (1) it should have been trained on 'enough' examples, (2) it should fit the training data (3) it should be 'simple'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has about 139 unique values. I was recently at a conference about AI and Ralf, the director of machine learning at Amazon, said that they usually try to have at least one example for each unique value. We have 300 samples in our training set so we are in good shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the following algorithms for my project:\n",
    "\n",
    "** Naive Bayes: **\n",

    "Naive Bayes model is used for the following three applications:\n",
    "* SPAM Detection\n",
    "* Text classification\n",
    "* Hybrid Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of Naive Bayes is that it can be trained very fast compared to more sophisticated models. Since the Naive Bayes Classifier works with distributions (Gaussian, Bernoulli) one is also flexible enough to try different distributions to fit the data well. One downside of Naive Bayes that due to its simplisity it might not work well for very complex problem spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose Naive Bayes because the algorithm only needs a small sample size to learn the necessary parameters. Since we only have information about 300 students in our training set this is important.\n",

    "Support Vector Machines can be applied in the following three circumstances:\n",
    "* Credit Card Fraud\n",
    "* Handwriting Detection\n",
    "* Image Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines maximize the margin between the different classes in a dataset, which allows this algorithm to generalize really well. The algorithm is also extremly flexible due to the different kernel functions available. The performance of Support Vector Machines starts to deteriorate when the feature space is much larger than the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose SVM's because we have more samples than unique features. Furthermore, if this algorithm performs well I intend to try different kernels with GridSearch.\n",

    "** Boosting: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting can be used for Face Detection because it saves on computation cost and maintains accuracy compared to other classifiers.\n",

    "One advantage of Boosting is that there are less parameters to tune: weak classifier, depth and learning rate. However, boosting can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers.\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."

    "In my opinion not only the peformance and training/prediction time matters, but also which types of mistakes are made. For some students it may be catastrophic, when they are predicted to graduate, but are actually at risk - this would be a false positive.\n",
    "To evaluate the models based on this metric I implemented a confusion matrix - the false positives are in the top right corner. The model, that performs best, while also minimizing the number of false positives is the model based on the AdaBoostClassifier. Furthermore, this model also performs the best on the majority of students (i.e. 300 samples).\n",

    "In the problem at hand we are trying to decide whether students will graduate using an algorithm. Let's think about this if we were using teachers A, B, C, D and E instead for a moment. \n",
    "Each teacher records their best guess about each student, using all the information they have on their students.At the end of the year they know whether the actually students graduated. It turns out that maybe teacher A's guesses proved more accurate than the guesses of teacher B. It also turned out that when theachers C and D agreed they were usually right. The guesses of teacher E turned out to be mostly inaccurate though. In the next year to accomodate what they learned accurate for students who take science classes, while teacher E's guesses are very accurate for students who take a lot of college prep classes. In the next year the weights of the teachers guesses are changed to accomodate for their repspective area of expertise. Ada Boosting works similarly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AdaBoosting algorithm starts by plotting all the data and finding a straight line to divide our dataset into students who will and will not graduate. After the first iteration the points that were in the wrong group (i.e. the algorithm got wrong) are assigned a higher importance (weight). In the next iteration the algorithm tries to find a better line to divide the dataset focusing on the more important points. The line dividing the dataset is called a weak classifier. This is repeated a lot of times and each time the importance of the point is updated. Essentially in the first stage we get houndreds or even thousands of opinions (weak classifiers) about in which group a given students should belong - in our analogy each weak classifier would represent a teachers opinion. These are by no means perfect, in fact they are often only a little bit better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next stage we have to figure out which combination of these opinions ist most effective at predicting the students group and combine all of them into one model. For each weak classifier we can calculate the error by multiplying the importance weight of each point that was misclassified times one. We combine these opinions by giving the best opinions (i.e. with lowest error) the most influence in the final model - similarly to how the weights of the teachers guesses changed at the end of the year. This is done using a weighted sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model is essentially a large function consisting of each weak classifier and its weight. In order to get a prediction you just input the values of each feature into the function."

    "With GridSearch I was able to improve the performance on the test set by 1% compared to the untuned model. Using a larger parameter space and RandomSearchCV I was able to improve the model by another 1% to 0.7883 and reduced the number of false positives. When I implemented the larger parameter space into GridSearchCV I was able to achieve almost the same score. Using cross validation I was able to increase the score to 0.7914.\n",

    "What is notable is that the number of false positives actually increased in the tunes model, while the number of false negatives decreased quite a lot. Although the increase in false positives is certainly bad, the drastic decrease in false negatives is really good because it saves the school costs, since there are fewer unnecessary interventions. This type of tradeoff is something the school board would have to decide on."
